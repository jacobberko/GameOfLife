Welcome to The Game of Life!
Read on for installation instructions to get playing:

Here is what we are going to install:
1. A Unix development environment
2. OPAM, the OCaml package manager
3. An OPAM switch with the OCaml compiler and some packages.

Then, we will learn how to play the game.

Let's Begin!

STEP 1: A Unix development environment:

Linux:
-> You have already completed this step!

Mac:
-> You have two options here, but make sure to choose ONLY one; you can install 
either Homebrew or MacPorts. Detailed instructions follow:
  Homebrew:
  -> Open the terminal on your computer by going to Launchpad
  and then searching for terminal. After opening, paste the 
  following into the terminal:
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  -> You have successfully completed step 1!

  MacPorts:
  -> Open the terminal on your computer by going to Launchpad
  and then searching for terminal. After opening, paste the
  following into the terminal:
    xcode-select --install
  -> Now, go to https://www.macports.org/install.php and find the download link
  under Quickstart step 2 that corresponds to your operating system,
  and follow installation instructions.
  -> You have successfully completed step 1!

Windows:
-> Unix development in Windows is made possible by the Windows Subsystem for 
Linux (WSL). If you have a recent version of Windows 
(build 20262, released November 2020, or newer), WSL is easy to install. 
If you don’t have that recent of a version, try running Windows Update to get it.
  -> With a recent version of Windows, and assuming you've never installed WSL
  before, here's what you have to do:
    1. Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator. To do that, click Start, 
    type PowerShell, and it should come up as the best match. 
    Click “Run as Administrator”, and click Yes to allow changes.
    2. Run wsl --install. (Or, if you have already installed WSL but not Ubuntu 
    before, then instead run wsl --install -d Ubuntu.) When the Ubuntu download 
    is completed, it will likely ask you to reboot. Do so. The installation will
    automatically resume after the reboot.
    3. You will be prompted to create a Unix username and password. You can use 
    any username and password you wish. It has no bearing on your Windows 
    username and password (though you are free to re-use those). Do not put a 
    space in your username. Do not forget your password. You will need it in the 
    future.
    4. Now proceed to the Ubuntu setup paragraph below.
  -> Without a recent version of windows:
    -> Follow the instructions on the following link:
      https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual
      (Note that WSL2 is preferred over WSL1 by OCAML, so install WSL2 if you can.) 
  UBUNTU SETUP:
  -> These rest of these instructions assume that you installed Ubuntu (20.04) 
  as the Linux distribution. That is the default distribution in WSL. In 
  principle other distributions should work, but might require different 
  commands from this point forward. Open the Ubuntu app. (It might already be 
  open if you just finished installing WSL.) You will be at the Bash prompt, 
  which looks something like this:
    -> user@machine:~$
    -> Enable copy-and-paste:

      Click on the Ubuntu icon on the top left of the window.

      Click Properties

      Make sure “Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste” is checked.

      Now Ctrl+Shift+C will copy and Ctrl+Shift+V will paste into the terminal. 
      Note that you have to include Shift as part of that keystroke.

  -> Run the following command to update the APT package manager, which is what 
  helps to install Unix packages:
    -> sudo apt update
  -> Now run the following command to update all the APT software packages:
    -> sudo apt upgrade -y
  -> Then install some useful packages we will need:
    -> sudo apt install -y zip unzip build-essential
  -> You have successfully completed step 1!

STEP 2: OPAM, the OCaml Package Manager:    
  INSTALLING OPAM:
  Linux:
  -> Follow the instructions on https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html for your 
  distribution.

  Mac:
  -> If you're using Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal:
    -> brew install opam
  -> If you're using MacPorts, run the following command in your terminal:
    -> sudo port install opam

  Windows:
  -> Run the following command in Ubuntu:
    -> sudo apt install opam 

  INITIALIZE OPAM:
  Linux, Mac, and WSL2:
  -> Run the following command:
    -> opam init --bare -a -y
  WSL1:
  -> Run the following command:
    -> opam init --bare -a -y --disable-sandboxing  

  -> You have successfully completed step 2!  

STEP 3: Create an OPAM Switch:
  -> Create a swtich for this game by running the following command:
    -> opam switch create gameoflife-2023fa ocaml-base-compiler.5.0.0
  -> Run this command to logout:
    -> eval $(opam env)
  -> Now install the OPAM packages we'll need by running this command:
    -> opam install -y utop odoc ounit2 qcheck bisect_ppx menhir ocaml-lsp-server ocamlformat ocamlformat-rpc
      -> (NOTE: We will not need all of these packages to run the game.)
-> CONGRATULATIONS! You have finished step 3 and are ready to play!


HOW TO PLAY:
  -> The Game of Life is based entirely in the terminal of your system. Therefore,
  you will need to open the terminal on your computer to play the game.
  Once in your terminal, navigate to the directory that contains the game file
  (it is the same directory that contains this install file). Once in the directory,
  you can begin the game by typing the following command into your terminal:
    -> make game
  -> Congratulations on a successful install, enjoy!
